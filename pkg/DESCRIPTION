Description: An infrastructure for the management of survey data including
        value labels, definable missing values, recoding of variables,
        production of code books, and import of (subsets of) 'SPSS' and
        'Stata' files is provided. Further, the package allows to produce
        tables and data frames of arbitrary descriptive statistics and
        (almost) publication-ready tables of regression model
        estimates, which can be exported to 'LaTeX' and HTML.
