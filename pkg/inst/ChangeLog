  - Added documentation for 'as.character' method for 'codebook' objects.
  - Implemented 'Write()' convenience function for 'descriptions' objects.

2015-02-13:
  - Removed 'aggregate.formula' method as it conflicts with a method of the name that was included
    into the 'base' R package more or less recenlty.
  - Removed 'include' and 'uninclude' since it modifies (in a benign way though) the global namespace,
    which is discouraged by recently changed CRAN policies.

2015-01-26:
  - Added 'as.character' method for 'codebook' objects, to allow conveniently write the to files using 'writeLines'

2015-01-25:
  - Explicitly export S3 method as required by package check by more recent R version
  - Added github URL
  - Listed packages that are 'enhanced' by supporting them for `mtable`

2014-12-14:
  - Correct buglet in 'recode' method for numeric vectors

2014-11-04:
  - Fixed silly bug introduced in recent update: Long variable names in SPSS "sav" files should work again now.

2014-10-11:
  - added method for "merMod" objects to the getSummary() generic function. mtable() now 
    should be able (again) to handle estimation results produced by lmer() and glmer() from 
    package 'lme4'.
  - recode() handles character vectors in a more convenient way: They are converted
    into factors with sorted unique values (after recoding) as levels.

2014-09-08:
  - 'getSummary.glm' now takes care of missing values in weights of glm objects.

2014-08-19:
  - modified some code that Prof Ripley thinks looks 'suspicious'.

2014-06-24:
  - Change of SPSS variable names to lower case is now optional (but still the default).

2014-03-10:
  - Removed modification to getSummary.clm that slipped in from a development branch.

2013-12-06:
  - fixes out-of-bound error and memory leak in 'pspp-portableStream-for-R.c'
    reported by Prof. Ripley.  Eliminated calls to non-exported functions from 'lattice'.
    Marked all example code of 'Simulate' as 'dontrun' to save time during package checks.
    Also did some cosmetic changes to the package vignette 'anes48'.

2013-09-19:
  - fixes of some namespace import issues.

2013-07-28:
  - fix of 'data.set()' and 'Table()' functions.
    Thanks to Gabor Grothendiek and Jeremy Jackson 

2013-03-20:
  - getSummary method for "mer" objects was broken and now is fixed.

2013-02-10:
  - getSummary methods for "ivreg", "tobit" (from package "AER"),
    "hurdle", "zeroinfl" (from package "pscl"),
    "betareg" (from package "betareg"),
    "multinom" (from package "nnet"),
    contributed by Achim Zeileis,
    were included into the package, but had not been exported yet
    from the package namespace.
    This is now fixed.

2013-01-27:
  - Minor improvement of 'codebook' output for external SPSS data sets.
  - Fixed a bug in 'dumbswap.c' discovered while building a windows binary.

2013-01-26:
  - Included getSummary methods
     - for objects of classes "ivreg", "tobit" (from package "AER"),
                              "hurdle", "zeroinfl" (from package "pscl"),
                              "betareg" (from package "betareg"),
                              "multinom" (from package "nnet"),
                              contributed by Achim Zeileis
    - for objects of classes "polr" (from package "MASS"),
                             "clm" (from package "ordinal"),
                             "simex" (from package "simex"),
                             contributed by Christopher N. Lawrence
    - for objects of classes "coxph", "survreg" (from package "survival"),
                             "aftreg", "phreg", "weibreg" (from package "eha"),
                             contributed by Jason W. Morgan,
    - for exponentiated coefficients in glm-models,
                             contributed by Dave Atkins.
  - Made the 'spss.fixed.file' importer function more robust:
      - It works now, even if 'varlab.file', 'codes.file',
        or 'missval.file' arguments are missing. (This was broken by an earlier revision.)
      - It now handles value labels of character string variables correctly.

2013-01-04:
  - Updated contact email address. Corrected "initialize" method for "data.set" objects.

2012-02-14:
  - Replaced calls to .Internal(sample()) by calls to sample.int() and eliminated
    call to .Internal(int.unzip()). The package now depends on R >= 2.9.0

2012-01-25:
  - Fixed reading of value labels from SPSS system files - no garbage at the end of the labels.

2011-12-07:
  - Fixed "getSummary" and "getSummary.expcoef" S3-generic functions.

2011-11-06:
  - Added a 'rep' method for 'item.vector' objects.
  - Applied patch sent by Masahiro Hayashi <rinm884@gmail.com> to fix bugs
    in 'vector' method of 'recode'.

2011-10-05:
  - Adapted the package to R 2.14.0 (by eliminating calls to 'require'
    in the '.onLoad' function)
  - Changed the methods for data frames, 'data.set' and 'importer' objects
    of the function 'sort' from S3 to S4

2011-08-26:
  - Fixed a bug in internal function 'compress.storage.mode.double' that caused
    it to create NA's where it should not.
  - Fixed a bug in the print method for items that caused it to report their length
    incorrectly

2011-08-15:
  - Made internal functions of 'spss.fixed.file' robuster against syntax errors
    in the spss-controls files (codes.file, labels.file, etc.)

2011-06-17:
  - Removed mkHelpDir() that has not worked for a while because of architectural
    changes in R.
  - Removed some unused variables from the C-code that caused warnings.
  - Corrected a bug in format.mtable() misusing the function character()
    and some other buglets reported by NOTE's in automatic runs by CRAN.

2011-05-29:
  - Applied patch sent by Christopher N. Lawrence, Ph.D. <c.n.lawrence@gmail.com>:
    Added support to mtable() for clm and clmm ordinal models in the ordinal package.
    Updates getSummary to support mer objects as generated by recent versions of the lme4 package.
    Adds the Aldrich & Nelson pseudo-R2 (Aldrich and Nelson 1984)
    to mtable output for various categorical models.

2011-05-14:

  - Fixed problems with SPSS system files that do not contain an 'info_flt64' record. This problem led to zeroes in the data section of the file being erroneously interpreted as *sysmis*.
  - Fixed 'show' and 'print' methods for 'data.set' objects - they no do fit the width set by options(width=...), without ugly line breaks.
  - Changed the default value of the 'compress.storage.modes' option for the
    subset and bracket methods o 'importer' objects to FALSE, which is much
    more safer.

2010-07-16:
  - fixed a bug in 'Simulate' that caused it to fail in certain situations
    in R version >= 2.11.

2010-04-12:
  - 'toLatex(mtable(<something>),useDcolumn=FALSE)' should now produce useable
    LaTeX output ($'s are added to the table entries).

2010-04-09:
  - 'By' works now with 'genTable' and 'aggregate.formula'. It gains a 'data.frame'
    method, which better cooperates with calls to 'lm'-like functions. Their results
    get a 'data' component containing the subset of the data frame that was given
    as 'data' argument to the call of 'By'.

2010-04-08:
  - fixed bug in 'cases'. It works now with target expressions even with 'within'.
  - 'write.mtable' now handles a 'forLaTeX=TRUE' option in a more convenient way.
  - 'mtable' now handles objects of classes "polr" and "simex", thanks to a contribution
    from Christopher N. Lawrence (Texas A&M International University)
  - support for 'mtable' output for "glm" objects with exponentiated coefficients
    and prelininary support for "lmer" object added, thanks to a contribution from
    Dave Atkins (Unversity of Washington). Also the coef.styles are changed to be
    more convenient.

2010-04-07:
  - fixed bug in C-level function 'read_sysfile_subset' that caused spurious errors
    while importing SPSS 'system' files with long strings.

2010-03-18:
  - patch to trimws to make it locale-neutral

2010-03-11:
  - fixed bugs in mtable and format.mtable. Short 'summary.stats'
    arguments or 'summary.stats=FALSE' should work now.

2010-03-06:
  - fixed bug in genTable/percentage: total counts disappeared if
    a factor level had the same name as the name given to the total count
  - changed the default value of the 'digits' option of the matrix method
    of the toLatex generic to the more sensible getOption("digits")
  - the matrix method of the toLatex generic gains new optional arguments
    'show.vars', 'show.xvar', and 'show.yvar', which determine whether
    the name of the row and/or the column variable should be shown if
    the matrix is a 2-dimensional table.

2010-03-02:
  - fixed minor bug in 'cases' function

2009-11-11:
  - correction bug in .unLoad function.

2009-10-14:
  - removed 'extended' arguments from calls to 'regexpr' and 'sub' etc. (for compatibility
    with R 2.11)

2009-08-19:
  - corrected documentation for mtable (\usepackage instead of usepackage)
  - completed documentation for contrasts generic
  - fixed bug in the internals for 'spss.portable.file':
    'SPSS Por' to ascii and 'SPSS Por' to integer translation tables
    were one item too short.

2009-06-02:
  - as.factor methods for item vectors adapted to new factor function
    in R 2.10.0
  - Fixed bug in sample.data.frame and sample.data.set methods:
    Samples were drawn only from the first m observations, where m is
    the number of variables in the data frame/data set.
