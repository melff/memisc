One of the aims of this package is to make life easier for useRs who deal with survey data sets. It provides an infrastructure for the management of survey data including value labels, definable missing values, recoding of variables, production of code books, and import of (subsets of) SPSS and Stata files. Further, it provides functionality to produce tables and data frames of arbitrary descriptive statistics and (almost) publication-ready tables of regression model estimates, which can be exported to LaTeX and HTML.

Releases will be published on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/memisc/). Pre-releases will be available here in source and binary form. To install from the sources on GitHub you can use `devtools::install_github("melff/memisc",subdir="pkg")`.
